>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

When command line is accepted, store this into variable. 
And split it with deliminiter " " (space), save as array of file name and arguments. (argv[])
While parsing command line, count number of arguments. (argc)
and then, iterate the member of argv, from last one, store "char" values in stack
by subtracting size of "argv[i]" from stack pointer(esp).
Also while doing this, store the address of each argument's first charactor. (argv_addrs[])
Then, the value of arguments are stored in a right order. 
And then, align the stack space by insert padding and null address to argv[argc].
Next, store each argument's address from argv[argc - 1] to argv[0] by subtracting 
size of char*'s pointer from stack pointer like previous step.
Finally, insert address of argv[], argc, and return address. Then all of argument parsing is done.

Also we implemented argument passing to have maximum limit of the number of arguments
to avoid stack overflow. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

According to implementation of strtok(), it use "static" variable so it is
stored in data section. It can cause vulnerability because it can be accessed
at anywhere so it can changed by other thread. Otherwise, strtok_r is safe because
it does not use global variables.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.

>> single process?

File descriptors are associated with opend files' information(struct file) 
of each process providing index number of them.
And as mentioned right above, they are unique within each single process.

---- ALGORITHMS ----


>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

- reading
It checks if the file descriptor is valid. And retrieves the buffer pointer and validates it.
If the file descriptor is 0 (standard input), it reads characters from input until the specified size or null character is encountered.
If the file descriptor is greater than 1 (file), it retrieves the file associated with the descriptor and reads from it into the buffer.
The number of bytes read is stored in read_size and returned.

- writing
It checks if the file descriptor is valid. And then retrieves the buffer pointer and validates it.
If the file descriptor is 1 (standard output), it writes the buffer contents to the console using putbuf().
If the file descriptor is greater than 1 (file), it retrieves the file associated with the descriptor and writes from the buffer to the file.
The number of bytes written is stored in write_size and returned.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

In my implementation of wait system call, 
First, find child thread from current thread. (Especially, check whether 
the target thread id are exist in child_list)
If child are not exist, return -1. 
And then, check waiters of child's sema that indicates terminated for 
prevent duplicated wait. If that case, return -1.
Finally, wait for child's exit by holding semaphore which name is "is_terminated".
If thread_exit() called at child thread, that semaphore are released.
then return the exit status.

First of all, we implemented and used a customized function that 
validates the address to handle errors without obscuring the main 
functions of the code. This allows error processing by separating 
it from the logic of the main function.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

In our implementation, if load fails and "exec" system call return -1 and
convey the status to caller thread by set status in "eax" register.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

First, we implemented child and parent by adding child_list member, so that 
every thread are aware of each child threads. So, they are can be checked 
whether they are parent-child relation.
And we implemented "wait" system call by using semaphore, so that prevent 
race condition. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

We take a strategy that apply validity checking logic to user memory address.
In our implementation, we check first the user address are valid (exist in a 
correct range of user memory space) and if invalid, exit thread.
By using this method, kernel can access user memory safely.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

Since the capacity is implemented as a fixed array, 
there is a disadvantage in that it occupies a fixed capacity of 128. 
However, in the case of implementing this method, 
it has the advantage of taking faster time to refer to each file descriptor 
than the method of implementing it with a linked list.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We didn't change that.
